Start of the readme. 

This is going to be a long readme file... Sorry Darcy. 


I know you tried to make this assignment as easy as possible for us which was awesome of you.

As you know by now Im not the greatest coder, I have no plans on ever touching code again once I finish this program, 

I just want to be a web designer/UX designer. I really did try on your assignment but I wasnt able to get very far 

using jade and sass. So I went ahead and did it in html and css which I know you didnt want but this was the only way 

for me to get more then a single page. I had the gulp and gulp watch working in the terminal with your code. But couldnt get 

it working with mine.
