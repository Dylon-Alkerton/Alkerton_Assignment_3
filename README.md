Start of the readme. 

This is going to be a long readme file... Sorry Darcy. 


I know you tried to make this assignment as easy as possible for us which was awesome of you.

As you know by now Im a shit coder, I have no plans on ever touching code again once I finish this program, 

I just want to be a web/UX designer. I really did try on your assignment but I wasnt able to get very far 

using jade and sass. So I went ahead and did it in html and css which I know you didnt want but this was the only way 

for me to get something done. I had the gulp and gulp watch working in the terminal with your code. But couldnt get it working with mine.

I know I could have asked for extra help, but honestly its just embarrassing my know how of js so this advanced js was so over my head 

from the start which was not your fault you just got stuck with me, so I didnt want to waste your time. I think youre a great teacher and a 

good guy. It was really nice having a chance to meet you. All the best Darcy. 

p.s Please pass me !
